## Playing Quoridor by Coevolving Neural Networks

The project aims to create a Quoridor-playing agent using competitive co-evolution, and to see how this compares in play against current leading methods used in Quoridor-playing agents. The method I will be using will be to coevolve networks from 2 populations (one for the player going first, one for the player going second) that will output a distribution over all legal moves indicating which move is best, based on input data of the board state along with the remaining wall pieces for each player. The networks will be coevolved using a pairwise dominance co-evolutionary algorithm (PDCoEA)to reduce computation. I expect to produce a Quoridor agent capable of playing the game at minimum to a competitive human level and be able to quantitatively measure the performance of the agent against existing methods by playing matches between agents. I will also compare the value of using the more efficient PDCoEA against the Na√Øve all-vs-all CoEA.
